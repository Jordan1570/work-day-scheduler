# work-day-scheduler

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a work day schedule revolving around daily business hours. 

- This project was built to keep our work day organized

- The problem that this project solves is that it will prevent people from forgetting what they have planned for the day. They may also need to jot down something new they need to do. 

- I learned that you can utilize columns to give a webpage structure.
